      Hi. My name's Sam Winchester. I'm sure you've already heard of me. (Not to sound like Dean.) I have been hunting since twelve, alongside Dean and my dad. We've saved this world COUNTLESS of times. I'd like to continue to hunt, save lives, and rid this world of evil with a group a bit more empathetic and reasonable than the British Men of Letters, but with as much resources to help me and my brother out. There's no better candidate. Not even Death can stop us- believe me he tried. (By the way, we've killed Death before.)
