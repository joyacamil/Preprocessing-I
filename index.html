* [ ] Content: Intro - Have a short introduction as to why you would be a good hire
* [ ] Content: Skills - Showcase a list of skills you have somewhere on your resume
* [ ] Content: Work History - Showcase your work history somewhere on your resume
* [ ] Content: Contact - Provide some way a potential employer could contact you.  Phone number, email, or a full on contact form (doesn't have to work)
* [ ] Variables: Incorporate variables in your project for color and font stacks.  
* [ ] Nesting: Every selector should be nested inside the main container.  Avoid having global styles unless they are element level.
* [ ] Mixins: Create 2 mixins of your choosing. Hint: It's super helpful to use flexbox properties in mixins
* [ ] Mobile: Use nested-at rules to provide a mobile version of your resume.  Use `500px` as a `max-width` for mobile.
